/**
 * Common Application Configuration Names.
 * 
 * Stored in the SettingsRepository there are global configuration objects
 * consisting of name / value pairs. Different parts of the application are
 * coded to look up specific configuration parameters to determine how the
 * application should respond in specific circumstances. The static values
 * defined here are the common definitions for those configuration parameters.
 * This allows these names to be defined in one location while being statically
 * linked throughout the application.
 * 
 * Future developers, feel free to add additional configuration parameters to
 * this class as needed.
